# reducing_inequality

Repository for "Disaggregated Interventions to Reduce Inequality."

arXiv: <https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00593>

Includes supporting code and data to reproduce figures and results. 
To generate figures and print results from the paper, run `plot_results.ipynb`.
To re-run optimization problems, run `optimize_disaggregated.py` and `optimize.py` in that order.
New result files (`.npy`) will be output upon re-running. Note that re-running is slow.
Additional documentation and significant code restructuring forthcoming!
